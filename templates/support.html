    The e-Science Centre uses the <a href="https://ggus.eu/">GGUS helpdesk</a>
    service for submitting and managing technical support queries. An EGI Check-in
    account is required to use it, which you will be asked to create or log
    in to before creating your ticket.
</p>
<p>
    When filling out the ticket form, please ensure that the ticket is assigned to "PITHIA e-Science Centre"
    or our support unit will not receive notification of your ticket. You can specify this support unit from
    the <strong>Assign to support unit</strong> section within the form.
