# PITHIA e-Science Centre
The code base for the PITHIA e-Science Centre Prototype.

## Install
First, you will need to set up your local machine to be able to run Django projects on your localhost. For this, please follow the [official Django quick install guide](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/intro/install/). For the _Set up a database_ section in the guide, please see the _Set up a local MongoDB database section_ below.

### Clone the GitHub repo
Assuming you have a terminal application installed (if not, [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) is recommended), copy the clone link for this repository and run `git clone <repo clone link>` from your terminal.

### Set up a local MongoDB database
The project communicates with a MongoDB database. To set up a local database for development, please follow the [official Install MongoDB guide](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/guides/server/install/).

### Set up a .env file
The project has environment variables which are stored in a `.env` file. To create this file, please create a nameless file with the `.env` extension in the `pithiaesc` folder of this project. Listed below are the variable names and some descriptions on setting up them up:
- `SECRET_KEY` - Django uses a `SECRET_KEY` variable to [generate hashes](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7382149/whats-the-purpose-of-django-setting-secret-key). A value for this variable can be generated by running `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe())"` ([SOURCE](https://humberto.io/blog/tldr-generate-django-secret-key/)) in your terminal (assuming you are using Python 3.6+). 

- `MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING` - The url used to connect to the MongoDB database. If you followed the [official Install MongoDB guide](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/guides/server/install/), the value for this variable should be `http://localhost:27017/`.
- `DB_NAME` - The name of the MongoDB database. Set this to `pithia-esc`.

### Run the project on your machine
Now that Django, the MongoDB database and the .env file are set up, you should now be able to run the project on your local machine. To do this, first, navigate to the root project folder from your terminal (e.g., `cd ~/Documents/Projects/pithia-esc-gui-poc`), then run the command for your operating system, listed below:
- **MacOS/Linux**: `python manage.py runserver`
- **Windows**: `py manage.py runserver`
