    <description>
A vertical-incidence ionospheric sounder (ionosonde) observes the overhead ionosphere properties by using 
a high-frequency (HF) swept-frequency probing signal transmitted and received by the instrument.

        <description>The system steps through frequencies according to
            the selected program, transmitting and coherently integrating (a full
            spectrum, i.e. FFT, Doppler integration) a stream of N pulses. Just prior
            to transmission on each frequency four possible operating frequencies are
            monitored for interference/occupancy and the quietest is selected for the
            measurement. Then a few trial pulses are transmitted to allow automatic
            adjustment of receiver gain. As each coherent integration of pulse streams
            in completed, the raw output (i.e. 128 color coded amplitudes representing
            echoes at 128 heights) is added to the display of the developing ionogram.
            After all frequency steps have been completed the raw ionogram (16 complex
            Doppler lines at 256 heights and M frequency steps) is written out to a
            disk file and the automatic scaling program ARTIST (Automatic Real-Time
            Ionogram Scaler with True height analysis), is invoked and a file of
            automatically scaled parameters is created and displayed.</description>

            <description>This is similar to the Doppler Ionogram in that
                higher Doppler resolution is achieved by extending the integration period.
                In addition to multiplexing frequencies the receive antennas are also
                multiplexed. This provides a raw data file which records the relative
                phase of all Doppler lines of all echoes on the four antennas in the
                receiver array, giving the angle of arrival of the individual echoes.</description>
